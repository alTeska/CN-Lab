HH Model:
  ☐ frequency experiment
  ☐ simplification experiment(reduce m with m = 1-h) - removes one differential equation

  ☐ steady state values diagram
  ☐ gating variables and conductance graphs
  ☐ implus graph:
    ☐ one plot with 4 subsections
    ☐ stimulations
    ☐ plot of current
    ☐ plot of voltage
  ☐ jupyter file + descriptions
