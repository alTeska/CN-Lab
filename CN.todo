Coffee example:
  ☐ add slope to the diagram

HH Model:
  ☐ steady state values diagram
  ☐ implus graph
  ☐ gating variables and confuctance graphs
  ☐ frequency experiment
  ☐ jupyter file


Ad HH exercise
  3) how to simplyfy?
    -> get read of m, cause small
    -> m=1-h or the other way around, we are throwing them togheter, one differential equation
